- API needs to work with key authentication globally (not just the store view)
- Record errors with client information in API
- Record client information with each event
- Pause/Play, Sort By, and Notification settings should be saved in a cookie
- Potentially add graphs per server/url/etc ?
- Make uninteresting frames in stacktraces opaque
