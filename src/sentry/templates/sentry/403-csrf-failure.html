          <p>You are seeing this message because Sentry requires a 'Referer
           header' to be sent by your Web browser, but none was sent. This header is
           required for security reasons, to ensure that your browser is not being
           hijacked by third parties.</p>

          <p>If you have configured your browser to disable 'Referer' headers, please
           re-enable them, at least for this site, or for HTTPS connections, or for
           'same-origin' requests.</p>
