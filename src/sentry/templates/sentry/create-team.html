        <div class="help-block">
          A team generally represents a group of people within your organization. It might be something like <strong>"Platform"</strong> or <strong>"API"</strong>, or it could just be a specific product that may (or may not) have sub-projects. You'll be able to select which teams a member in your organization has access to so they also act as ACLs.

        <h3>Project</h3>

        <div class="help-block">
          Projects generally pair up well with repositories. In addition to thinking about each repository being a project, also consider your environments. You might have something like <strong>"Backend"</strong> or <strong>"Frontend (Staging)"</strong>.
